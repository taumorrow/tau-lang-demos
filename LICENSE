================================================================================
RESTRICTION: PROVABLY FAIR MULTIPLAYER GAMING
================================================================================

COMMERCIAL USE OF THE FOLLOWING IS PROHIBITED without explicit written license:

"Provably Fair Multiplayer Gaming Technology" means the SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL
COMBINATION of the following innovations:

1. TEMPORAL STATE MACHINE FOR GAMING RNG
   Integration of multi-party cryptographic commitments with Tau Language temporal
   state carryover, specifically:
   
   lfsr[t] = next[t-1] + seed[t]  // Temporal carryover from previous state
   next[t] = xorshift(lfsr[t])    // PRNG transformation
   dice[t] = (next[t] % 6) + 1    // Deterministic mapping
   
   Creating history-dependent randomness where identical commitment values at
   different timesteps produce different outcomes, preventing pattern exploitation.

2. INTERACTIVE MODE ARCHITECTURE FOR REAL-TIME FORMAL VERIFICATION
   Use of Tau Language's `run always` interactive mode with persistent subprocess
   architecture for stream-based validation in gaming, enabling:
   - State preservation between validation steps
   - Batch processing of multiple players simultaneously
   - Practical real-time performance through architectural optimization
   
3. MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE FOR TAU-BASED GAMING
   Decomposition of Tau-based game validation into independent microservices
   each running persistent Tau subprocesses, enabling parallel initialization and scalable deployment.

4. SIMULTANEOUS COMMITMENT-BASED GAMEPLAY WITH TAU VALIDATION
   4-phase game loop (Commit → Reveal → Validate → Execute) where:
   - All players submit cryptographic commitments simultaneously
   - Fair dice generation via XOR of all commitments
   - Tau Language validates all moves through decidable temporal logic
   - All actions execute simultaneously with mathematical proof of fairness

5. FAIR COLLISION RESOLUTION VIA TEMPORAL LOGIC
   "Who moves survives" collision detection and resolution expressed as
   Tau Language temporal constraints, providing provably fair multi-player
   interaction without priority-based or first-come-first-served systems.

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THIS LICENSE (Prior Art / Third-Party IP):

✗ XOR-based cryptographic commitments alone (standard cryptography, 40+ years old)
✗ Tau Language itself and all IDNI intellectual property (separate license)
✗ Generic constraint solving techniques (prior art)
✗ Post-hoc cryptographic verification systems (e.g., Bitcoin casino-style)
✗ Basic commitment schemes (prior art)
✗ SAT/SMT solving in general (prior art)

WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROTECTED:

✓ The specific combination and integration of techniques listed above
✓ The architectural patterns for Tau-based gaming
✓ The temporal state machine design for gaming RNG
✓ The interactive runner mode discoveries and implementation patterns
✓ The microservices architecture for formal verification gaming
✓ The specific Tau Language formulas and specifications developed
✓ The  multi phase simultaneous gameplay validation loop

PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL USES (without license):

- Operating online casinos, gambling platforms, or betting services using
  the protected technology combination
- Providing provably fair gaming as a commercial service using this architecture
- Integration of the protected technology into commercial gaming products
- White-label gaming solutions using the protected architectural innovations
- Any revenue-generating deployment of the specific technological combination

This restriction applies ONLY to the specific "Provably Fair Multiplayer Gaming
Technology" as defined above. All other uses remain unrestricted under MIT terms.
