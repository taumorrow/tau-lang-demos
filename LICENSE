PATENT NOTICE
================================================================================

The licensor reserves all patent rights to the provably fair multiplayer gaming
innovations described above (NOT to Tau Language itself, which belongs to IDNI).

These gaming innovations may be subject to patent protection and include:
- Multi-party XOR seed generation for gaming
- Simultaneous commitment-based game mechanics
- Novel collision resolution methods
- Integration patterns for real-time constraint verification in games

The licensor reserves the right to file patent applications for these innovations.
Commercial use of these gaming innovations outside authorized channels may
constitute patent infringement if patents are granted.

CLARIFICATION: This notice does NOT claim any rights over Tau Language,
IDNI technologies, or general constraint solving methods. It applies ONLY to
the specific gaming applications and mechanics developed by the licensor.

================================================================================

Unauthorized commercial use of provably fair multiplayer gaming technology
constitutes:
1. Breach of this license agreement
2. Potential patent infringement  
3. Copyright violation

The licensor reserves all legal remedies including injunctive relief and
damages.

GOOD FAITH PROVISION:
Inadvertent violations will be given 30-day cure period before legal action.
