# Hello, let's design our own worlds first realtime democracy system in Tau language!
# From voices to consensus let's explore how Tau language helps us 
# understand future voting systems and democracy in the digital age.

# First, let's build the blocks of your own digital democracy:
# Basic voice inputs - these represent our voters
bdd i1 = ifile("steady.in")
# Pattern: 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
bdd i2 = ifile("dynamic.in")
# Pattern: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
bdd i3 = ifile("reactive.in")
# Pattern: 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1

# First we define a basic output to see the consensus of nodes, participants, voices
bdd o1 = ofile("consensus.out")

# This establishes three input streams (voters) and one output stream (results). Each input file contains a sequence of 1s and 0s representing yes/no votes.

# Let's define what a majority looks like:
# majorityRule(a, b, c) := (a & b) | (b & c) | (a & c)

# Simple majority check
r o1[t] = (i1[t] & i2[t]) | (i2[t] & i3[t]) | (i1[t] & i3[t]) 24

# majorityRule checks if any two voters agree (that's a majority of three)
# a & b: first two voters agree
# b & c: last two voters agree
# a & c: first and last agree
# The OR operator | means any of these combinations counts as a majority

# Now let's make our democracy smart by adding memory of previous votes
bdd i4 = ifile("consensus.out")

bdd o2 = ofile("harmony.out")

# Define what complete agreement looks like
# unanimity(a, b, c) := a & b & c

# Check for complete agreement/perfect harmony
r o2[t] = (i1[t] & i2[t] & i3[t]) 24

# This checks if all three voters agree at each time step (perfect harmony)

# Let's add temporal stability - votes should stay stable unless there's strong disagreement
bdd o3 = ofile("stability.out")

r o3[t] = (i1[t] & i2[t]) | (i2[t] & i3[t]) | (i1[t] & i3[t]) & (i4[t-1] | (i1[t] & i2[t] & i3[t])) 24

# This adds "memory" to the system:
# Checks current majority AND either previous consensus OR current harmony
# This prevents rapid flip-flopping of decisions

# Now for a more advanced system that considers vote strength
bdd i5 = ifile("harmony.out")
bdd o4 = ofile("strength.out")

# Strong consensus means majority plus temporal stability
r o4[t] = ((i1[t] & i2[t]) | (i2[t] & i3[t]) | (i1[t] & i3[t])) & ((i1[t-1] & i2[t-1]) | (i2[t-1] & i3[t-1]) | (i1[t-1] & i3[t-1])) & i5[t] 24

# A strong consensus requires: current majority, previous majority, current harmony
# All must be true for "strong" consensus

# Finally, let's create a complete democratic system that combines all aspects
bdd i6 = ifile("strength.out")
bdd i7 = ifile("stability.out")
bdd o5 = ofile("democracy.out")

r o5[t] = (((i1[t] & i2[t]) | (i2[t] & i3[t]) | (i1[t] & i3[t])) | (i4[t-1] & i6[t])) & (i5[t] | i7[t]) 24

# The final system combines everything:
# Current majority OR (previous consensus AND strong consensus) AND (perfect harmony OR stability)

# This finally results in:
# consensus.out: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
# Think of this as our basic "Did most people agree?" measure 1 means YES (majority agreed)
# 0 means NO (majority disagreed). We see lots of agreement (many 1s)!
# harmony.out: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
# This shows when EVERYONE agreed: 1 means all voters said the same thing
# which is much rarer than basic consensus, it only happened 3 times!
# stability.out: 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
# Shows how steady our decisions were: 1 means the decision stayed stable
# 0 means opinions were changing. Notice the groups of stable periods!
# strength.out: 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
# This shows our strongest decisions: 1 means we had strong consensus
# needs current majority AND previous agreement. These are our most confident decisions!
# democracy.out: 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
# Our final democratic outcome: Combines all previous measures, shows our 
# most balanced decisions and takes into account stability and strength
# consensus:  1  (Majority agrees)
# harmony:    0  (But not everyone)
# stability:  1  (Decision is stable)
# strength:   1  (Strong consensus)
# democracy:  1  (Final decision: YES)


# Now try it yourself with different input patterns and see how the system behaves!
# Add more voter types like veto or experts
# Implement more complex rules like basic majority (3/5), supermajority (4/5),
# weighted voting, veto power, temporal stability
# Add multiple decision levels like basic consensus, strong consensus, expert 
# influence, veto checks, final combined decision
# Add new features like weighted votes for experts, veto power mechanics,
# supermajority requirements, multi-level decision making, complex stability rules

# Have phun!

# Questions to consider:
# 1. What happens when all voters agree?
# 2. How does temporal stability affect rapid opinion changes?
# 3. When do we get strong consensus vs weak consensus?
# 4. How does this relate to real-world voting systems?
